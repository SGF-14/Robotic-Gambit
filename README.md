Through our research in the field of artificial intelligence and robot technology, we aim to
build a project that serves fans of chess matches by simulating the playerâ€™s movements in
reality via a robot using the Arduino and enhancing his skills while applying them in reality
instead of online sites, as it will increase the experience of his skills in reality.
